## Description

_This Application will allow a user to play a Dice game against a computer opponent. The goal will be to get to 100 points. If user rolls a 1 they will score nothing for that turn and have to let the opponent roll. A roll of 2-6 will be added to total and the user will get to decide to keep rolling or let the opponent have a turn._
